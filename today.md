Goodmorning
[]

Let's talk about my day
[]

Today I woke up and took ly car to my appointment.
[]

I have an appointment at the garage Canadian Tire
[]

I had to get my tires changed
[]

after dropping off the car, I had to walk back to my place because I could not leave with the car befire they service it.
[]

Anyways, as I am walking, I run into cops
[]

They stopped me and asked me a few questions
[]

Cop: Hi, how are you?
[]

Me: I am doing alright, thank you for asking
[]

Cop: Why are you walking alone at this time if the day
[]

Me: I just cane from dropping off my car at the Canadian tire garage. I have an appointment at 8:00 AM
[] 

Cop: Why havent you changed your tires by now?
[]

Me: I could not find free time to do so, when I had the time, I was working so there was no chance to book a convenient one
[]

Cop: Oh, I see.
